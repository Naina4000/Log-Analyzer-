# 🔐 Log Analyzer – Mini SIEM Security Monitoring Tool

A **Python-based security log analysis and threat detection system** that simulates core capabilities of a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** platform.

The tool analyzes **SSH and Apache logs**, detects malicious activity, enriches alerts with threat intelligence, correlates incidents, and generates security reports.

This project demonstrates how **SOC detection pipelines** work in real-world cybersecurity environments.

---

# 🚀 Overview

Security teams rely heavily on log monitoring to detect attacks such as brute force attempts, web exploitation, and reconnaissance activity.

This project implements a **multi-layer log detection pipeline** that performs:

* Log parsing
* Threat detection
* Threat intelligence enrichment
* Incident correlation
* Security reporting

The goal is to simulate a **mini SIEM detection engine** for cybersecurity learning and portfolio demonstration.
